# feasibility

* The first project-related assignment is a viability assessment.
* Goals:
  * Create a github repo that demonstrates access to project data.
  * Perform some preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) and include the code.
  * Create a data visualization and describe its relevance to the project in one sentence.
* I'll assign a private github-classroom repository to the students in the project.
  * Note: Github classroom restricts access to anyone with the link and a github count.
  * Don't give the link anyone outside your project.
  * If you and your stakeholder are okay with taking the repo public, then let me know.
