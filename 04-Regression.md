### Goals

* Introduce statsmodels (applied to the advertising dataset)
* Introduce the scikit-learn estimator API 
* Model evaluation (ISLR Chapter 2) and hypothesis testing (ISLR Chapter 3) with linear regression

### Reading (for next week)

ISLR2 -- Chapter 4: Classification (read the sections listed below)

* Section 4.1 & 4.2
* Section 4.3 -- concepts only, don't worry about mathematical details
* Section 4.4 -- might be tough reading, so don't worry about details
  * Sections 4.4.1-3 -- LDA and QDA -- skim
  * Section 4.4.4 -- Naive Bayes -- concepts only, we'll be using this model
* Sections 4.5-4.8 -- Entirely optional (we won't be covering this material)

### polling

* polleverywhere questions based on reading for this week 
* [poll](poll.md)

### introduction to statsmodels

* [statsmodels.org](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
* statsmodels is a port of R-style statistics to Python
* there are two APIs -- DSL (Domain Specific Language) similar to R, and a numpy-friendly API
* [exercises](statsmodels.md)
