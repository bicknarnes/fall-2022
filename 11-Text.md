## Reading (for next week)

* TBD

## PCA (review)

* PCA -- SVD -- dimensionality reduction, unsupervised learning, and (to a lesser extent, as we'll see) clustering
* VanderPlas -- In Depth: PCA (p431)
* [05.09-Principal-Component-Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.09-Principal-Component-Analysis.ipynb)
  * We've seen PCA for dimensionality reduction with linear models in high dimensions.
  * We'll see it act as a clustering method with text (e.g., LSA with the 20 NewsGroups)
  * Performs fairly well as a clustering method when the features are uncorrelated
