# 08-Trees

* model selection -- regularization, PCA and PCR
* decision tree basics
* bagging and random forests

## Reading

* ISLR2 -- Chapter 8, Section 8.1: The Basics of Decision Trees (for Thursday)
* ISLR2 -- Chapter 8, Sections 8.2.1: Random Forests, 8.2.2: Bagging, 8.2.3: Boosting (for next week)
* ISLR2 -- Chapter 9, Sections 9.3.1: Support Vector Machines
  * Read for the concepts related to "Classification with Non-Linear Decision Boundaries"
  * After skimming 9.3.1 the first time, you may want to refer back to other parts of Chapter 9
  * We'll be applying the concepts in class and in homework assignments.
  * Don't miss Section 9.5 -- if nothing else, skim it!

## Dimensionality reduction

* [07-principal-components.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xc5SNhD9NY-4IGE-mGdPu8mdpPTxHIIf?usp=sharing)
* Can be put into a pipeline, just as we saw with the scikit-learn scandard scaler
* When we do so, we get PCR (Principal Component Regression) as discussion in Section 6.3.1 in ISLR2
