# Project opportunities -- Fall 2022

## Computer vision

* Stakeholder: Northeastern's [Augmented Cognition Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/ostadabbas/)
* Data: facial landmark coordinates from 300-W (adults) and InfAnFace (infants) datasets
  * Reference: [InfAnFace paper, Wan et al, ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08935) (2022) -- arxiv.org
  * InFanFace data and code: https://github.com/ostadabbas/Infant-Facial-Landmark-Detection-and-Tracking)
* Story/Goal: Use a simple ML model (e.g. regression tree) to distinguish adult & infant faces

## Stinky2

* Stakeholder -- Conservation Law Foundation
* Data -- http://github.com/ds5110/stinky2
* Story -- there are two of them
  * Data Viz (CS 7290) -- https://ds5110.github.io/stinky2 map needs updating (Sean Mahoney will visit to discuss)
  * Data Sci (DS 5110) -- need a smell-reports model (e.g., West End wind effects w/GLM see ISLR2, Section 4.6.2)

## Bioscience map of Maine

* Stakeholder -- Director of Life Sciences and Engineering
* Data -- She provided some excel files
* Story/goal: an interactice dashboard-map application that will expand with time

## Equitable medicaid and medicate allocations

* Stakeholder -- Prof in Dept of Health Sciences
* Data: There are several open data sources including medicare.gov, cms.gov, and hiv.gov
* Goal/Story -- Identify and visualize grossly underserved populations for elder care and people living with HIV. Research suggests that reallocation of medicare and medicate resources would lead to improved care.

## Social Capital from LinkedIn

* Stakeholder -- The Endurance Group
* Data -- LinkedIn and related data
* Story/Goal -- The Endurance Group Can you create a social capital score, that is, a quantitive metric to determone who's most likely to connect with you and help advance your carreer, e.g., university alum, location, former employee.
* Note: this could lead to a co-op opportunity in the spring

## Digital equity in Maine

* Stakeholder -- Maine Connectivity Authority
* Data -- FCC and census.gov
* Story/Goal -- Maine Connectivity Authority was established in 2021 as a quasi-governmental agency charged with achieving the universal access of affordable high-speed broadband in Maine. They are interested in developing a digital equity index -- including factors from census.gov and the relationships to areas with less broadband availability.

## AI Fairness

* Stakeholder -- Institute for Experiential AI, The Roux Instute
* Data -- [Law School Admission Dataset](http://www.seaphe.org/databases.php)
* Story/Goal -- We build machine learning models on a lot of datasets for various partners and industries. We would like to be able to have an automated process that we can run our algorithms against ground truth datasets to check whether they are biased or not.
